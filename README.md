### The Final Result

<p>The final result of the project is a running application as per the specicification, except the Custom user input which I've left out due to some 
  limitations with the Library I used for the countdown. But, At the end of the attempt, I've managed to implement all the required functionality, Enjoy using the app! Bzzzz!
